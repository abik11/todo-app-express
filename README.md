# todo-app-server
This is some kind my of playground to test and learn stuff connected to Node.js and **Express** which seem to be really cool technologies. By now you can find here:
* **multer** - little example of image uploading 
* **mongodb** - example of how to connect and retrive data from mongodb
<br />
Soon I will add here some REST api to manage *tasks to do* which will be used with two front end clients:
* [vue.js](https://github.com/abik11/todo-app-vue)
* [react](https://github.com/abik11/todo-app-react) (this one is just starting slowly.....) 
<br />
I really want to add some **mongoose** example too and maybe some **ejs** or handlebars.
